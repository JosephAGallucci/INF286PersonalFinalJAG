        <h2>Guitar Specifications/History</h2>

        I can't seem to figure out the exact origin of this specific model. I wanna say it came in a starter pack but I don't remember this ever coming in a starter pack
        <br>combined with the fact that had it been a pack, I would have had an Epiphone amp and not a Line 6. Perhaps it was some store bundle? Hard to say at this point.
        <br>Epiphone catalogs never listed this model but you can find old archives of people purchasing them off the rack. Stock it had a humbucker and cheaper tuners.

        <h2>Personal History</h2>

        Where it all began for me. This had to have been some kind of gift because I do not remember ever asking for a guitar. Regardless, I recieved it From
        <br>my grandfather who was an avid guitar fan. For the rest of the vacation I got this on and for a little while longer, I learned the basics of guitar on this...
        <br>until middle school came up, where I dropped it in favor of trumpet and didn't play guitar for years afterwards. When I did pick the instrument back up, I still
        <br>left this guitar abandoned in favor of other guitars/basses.
        <br>For my 19th birthday, I got new Kluson tuners and a Seymour Duncan Phat Cat, which is a P90 pickup in a humbucker case. This guitar then went
        <br>on the workbench and upgraded with said parts... before I snapped a string on the bridge a day later. I haven't really touched it since mostly
        <br>because I'd want to replace the bridge completely and my project ideas right now are targeted towards a different project.
