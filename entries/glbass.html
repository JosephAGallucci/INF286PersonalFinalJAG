        <h2>Guitar Specifications/History</h2>
        While the specifications sheet for this particular bass lists the instrument as being built in 2022, in fact it was purchased the following year. This color seems to be
        <br>one of the last of its kind, based on it's serial number, and was purchased as a B-stock model. However, the only issues listed were mild and did not affect the instrument that much. In contrast, the store
        <br>had another B stock LB-100, the very same model as this bass but with a different color, with notable finish damage. This bass only has a small finish issue that does not affect the playability.

        <h2>Personal History</h2>
        I had been looking for a nicer bass as a graduation gift, and spent many months over my last year of high school looking over different models and figuring out what I wanted.
        <br>By April, I had solidifed on the type of bass that I wanted - a Precision-style bass, yet this particular model snuck up on me. I had been out for what was at first just a normal vetting
        <br>session, where I tried out a few models to see what I liked... I walked out of Sweetwater that day with a bass in tow, not expecting to have one chosen out. From all of my bass collection,
        <br>this is my personal favorite for it's playability and sound.
