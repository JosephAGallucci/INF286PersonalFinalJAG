        <h2>Guitar Specifications/Details</h2>
        This is a Fender American Fat Telecaster built in 1999. The serial number indicates that it was made in 1998 but I did a serial number lookup
        <br>from Fender and it came back as being made in February 1999. The name "Fat" derives from its pickup configuration: the bridge pickup is the same
        <br>as a regular Telecaster, but the neck pickup is a "DH-1", which is a humbucker Fender was making around this time in the late 90s-early 00s. Regular
        <br>Telecasters have a single coil where this big humbucker is. To adjust to this, the switch on the guitar has five positions instead of three to account
        <br>for the extra sounds this model has.

        <h2>Personal History</h2>
        Upon starting guitar again, I had begun to develop this taste for Fenders. Then my grandfather hits me with this very guitar, shows it to me via
        <br>pictures... then proceeds to give a Made in America Fender when I had been playing for mere months. It had already gone through
        <br>at least 2 owners, as he mentioned purchasing it in 2005. To this day that still feels wrong given my playing ability at the time and the value of an American Fender.
        <br>However I played this guitar bascially exclusively from the moment I got it until my Epiphones got resurrected. Teles are viewed as country guitars
        <br>but it handles rock, punk and even metal like a champ. It's much snappier, twangier sound gives a slightly harder edge to the notes than a Les Paul does.
