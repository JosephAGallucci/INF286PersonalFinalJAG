        <h2>Personal History</h2>

        I don't know how exactly it got to where it is but this is another guitar courtesy of grandparents. I guess this was just part of the larger
        <br>collection and passed down. From there, it sat for a while until I began to play guitar again. At this time there was only the other Epiphone and 
        <br>this guitar... and I went towards this one instead of the other Epiphone and played this guitar for a while until I got my Fender.
        <br>Afterwards this guitar was left to rot in its case until a few months ago, when I brought this guitar back from the dead, cleaned it up, and brought
        <br>it back into rotation. Afterwards, however, I found it's really bad about breaking strings. Without a doubt this is the guitar that's broken the most strings for me.
        <br>Having played my Fender for so long, this guitar is definitely a different tonal character than that guitar. As a result, I tend to use it for deeper, darker
        <br>sounds that the snappier sounding Fender is unable to acheive easily.
