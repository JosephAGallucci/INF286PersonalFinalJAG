        <h2>Guitar Specifications</h2>
        <br>This is my primary acoustic guitar. It's not <em>strictly</em> an Ovation, rather being branded 
        <br>under the "Matrix" name. However the information inside the sound hole states the company of manufacture:
        <br>Kaman Music, who also owned Ovation. As such, this guitar shares many of Ovation's construction traits like 
        <br>the non-wood "bowl back" combined with the wood top and the aluminum/resin neck as opposed to a wooden neck. It does not, however, have a
        <br>pickup inside. This guitar's serial number dates to 1972, after an initial misunderstanding that it was made in 1982.

    <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
    This is a guitar I got from my grandfather, as part of collection liquidation. It's a bit smaller of a body shape, making
        <br>it a bit more comfortable for me as someone who mainly plays electric. Sometimes, regular acoustic guitars can feel a little bit
        <br>deep and uncomfortable on my body but this guitar feels much better in that regard. E Standard is also unattainable now because on its most recent string change, the A string tuner gets 
        <br>effectively stuck after tuning it enough. This guitar is mainly kept in E flat as a result but I like E flat so it's not a super big deal to me.
