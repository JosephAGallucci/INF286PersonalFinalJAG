        <h2>Guitar Specifications/History</h2>

        <br>This is a Sweetwater floor model Squier Classic Vibe 50's Precision Bass, based off of a 1956 Precision Bass. This means that while the body is contoured, it still has
        <br>the Tele-style single coil rather than the later style split-coil pickup. It's output jack broke in August 2022 out of seemingly nowhere, and had to get fixed up. 
        <br>Around mid 2023, I decided to substantially modify this bass in order to keep up with my nicer bass and to address a few issues that had started to creep up with age and
        <br>admittetly aggressive playstyle. First, the nut was swapped out for a TUSQ XL to address a playbility issue. Then, I changed the original bridge which had
        <br>started to wear down on the saddles to a Gotoh 201B. Next, I changed the original pickup out for a Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound, before finally changing out the stock white
        <br>pickguard to a black pickguard.

        <h2>Personal History</h2>
        I bought this bass on a family vacation about a week after I got the EB-3. At the time, I had family live near Fort Wayne where the Sweetwater campus is. So, we went to Sweetwater and came out
        <br>of the store with this bass. From there, it became my main instrument and is what I consider my formative bass. This is the bass that I brought to a Sweetwater Rock Camp and
        <br>played my first actual show on. It has also done quite a few recordings for both class projects and personal projects, pre-and-post modification.
