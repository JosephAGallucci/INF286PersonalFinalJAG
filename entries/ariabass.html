        <h2>Guitar Specifications/History</h2>

        The exact year of this bass is unknown, but given the background info I know on this bass, this is roughly from about 1972. As mentioned, this
        <br>is a copy of the Gibson EB-3 bass, made in Japan during what is these days referred to as the "lawsuit era", where Japanese companies went rampant
        <br>with making copies of American guitars, which by the end of the 70s became on par/better than the American counterparts. Unlike a Gibson, this bass
        <br>has a bolt-on neck and not the glued in neck of the Gibson.

        <h2>Personal History</h2>
        This is yet another instrument courtesy of my grandfather. He was the original owner, and mentioned how he had bought this bass after falling into the 
        <br>scenario of "too many guitar players, someone needs to play bass". From there, this bass just sat with him until I was given it... where its flatwound strings
        <br>were instantly yanked off. I had this bass for a week until I bought my Squier but has always remained in the collection. It was this bass that got me into my
        <br>first actual band, but only because my Squier broke on the output jack and this was the other bass that I had. It's tone doesn't really fit a lot of what I do
        <br>but it's a novel sound nonetheless, and one with quite a bit of family history.
