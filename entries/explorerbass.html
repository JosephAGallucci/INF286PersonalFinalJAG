        <h2>Guitar Specifications/History</h2>

        Amazon quality at its finest. This bass came together from a DIY kit that was put together over the course of a few weeks. It still has all of its stock (probably cheap)
        <br>hardware, such as the no-soldering electronics, except for the bridge. The kit contained a three-point bridge, a much maligned design that I did not want to even bother with. As a result, the body was modified to accept
        <br>a Fender style bridge. Originally, I put on a Gotoh 201B bridge, but a little over a year later that got replaced with a heavier Fender Hi-Mass bridge in a vain attempt
        <br>to make the body heavier. This was done to help counteract its neck dive, a design problem where the body is lighter relative to the neck, causing the guitar/bass to fall forward when not constantly held up.
        <br>This particular kit is not available anymore but you can still buy something very similar to it today.

        <h2>Personal History</h2>
        <img src="../images/ExplorerBack.jpg" width="302" height="403">
        My Squier broke at the output jack. Once it was fixed up, I had begun to devlop a desire to learn how a bass/guitar is made, mostly so I could get
        <br>closer to doing my own maintenance. Come Christmastime, and I ask for this bass DIY kit. I then recieve this kit and build it over the course of about 1-2 weeks. 
        <br>This bass is far from a great player, it's got this very big neck which truthfully is not a deal breaker, but certianly not as playable as my othere guitars. However, this bass suffers from neck dive, an
        <br>uncomfortable body shape, plus other things like the finnicky input jack output that broke on me. As a result, despite liking how this bass sounds I don't find myself
        <br>playing it for more than a few minutes at a time.
