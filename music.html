        <h2>Music I've Done</h2>

        <p>Below are two major pieces of music that I've written over the past few years</p>

        <div class="grid">
            <h2>A Mole is a Unit</h2>

            <audio controls>
                <source src="New Mole - 12:2:24, 10.56 PM.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>


            <p>This particular piece is not an original, but is rather
                a cover of a piece called "A Mole is a Unit", done in a different
                style to the original. I made this back in 2022 after hearing the original song
                in chemistry class. I had this impulse idea "what if I made a cover of this song."</p>

                <p>...I'm still half wondering if that was a good idea.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, I learned that song, created this arrangement for it, and played
                    all of the instruments on it.
                </p>

                <p>This particular arrangement is a re-record that I did the following year.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="grid">
            <h2>Going Up!</h2>

            <audio controls>
                <source src="Going Up Final - 12:2:24, 10.49 PM.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>

            <p>My most recent, currently unfinished work. This song spurred from an impulse thought at a Norse Code Radio meeting.</p>
            <p>"What if there was a song that sampled the talking elevators in Griffin Hall?"</p>
            <p>I had been starved for songwriting, so I took the idea and wrote the basic chords and feel of the song. Then, I 
                worked with another guitar player and trombone player to record and create the final version of this song. Myself, I played
            bass and produced the track.</p>
